as a liberal who has seen a lot of this behavior^Browsing r/politics and stumbled upon this great comment which IMO is one of the chief reasons the election swung the way it did. It describes perfectly what I have been seeing from a lot of students at UIUC:
whats a problem that you have with the uiuc campus^I'm doing a project concerning problems that the student body has with the uiuc campus and improvements we could make and I would like to know what the Reddit community thinks. It could be a problem or an opportunity that affects you.
experiences with racism at uiuc^I encountered various episodes of racism during my four years at UIUC, both overt and covert. Sometimes it was directed at me, but most often it was towards other people. I can confidently say it is a rampant problem on campus. I'd like to hear about other people's experiences if they're comfortable sharing.
uiuc what do you do here^Former student? Current student? What did/do you study? Let's get an idea of who frequents r/UIUC.
its been too long ive written a book about^For some reason, I haven't been able to reach anyone to get this event setup, BUT I reckon I'll have more luck here on this subreddit. Please direct assistance to epicbooktour@alexisohanian.com and then let's discuss where we should go for the /r/UIUC meetup after the book event.
to all those considering attending uiuc^The UIUC subreddit is probably actually a pretty terrible place to get an unbiased view of whether or not you should come here. Learn to use google and look up relevant information.
any complaints about uiuc^I am supposed to write a complaint letter on a service, product or policy of UIUC for one of my classes but I can't think of any thing really. Would really appreciate it if some people can give me some ideas on things.
happy birthday uiuc^Thought it is fortunate that we get to study at UIUC, and be able to witness the Sesquicentennial while being a student here. Happy 150th U of I.
patches is home thank you so much ruiuc for all^http://i.imgur.com/vFZRywm.jpg
cinda heerens final uiuc lecture 330pm reading^Cinda Heeren, long time CS faculty (CS 225 recently, CS 173 before that), is leaving us for UBC -- but not before she delivers one final goodbye lecture!
im applying for an exchange from the uk and ive^Hello r/UIUC !
cool little known things at uiuc^Sorry for the vague title, I didn't know how else to put it. Last semester, my friends and I found out about a jazz class that allows people to watch students play, and it has been amazing. we are second semester seniors and are wondering if there are other little known cool experiences like that at UIUC. I really want to get as much of the school as I can before I leave.
uiuc vs mit^Just got accepted into Gender and women's studies at uiuc and want to know how this compares to mechanical engineering at MIT.
greek life at uiuc^Hello redditors of UIUC!
uiuc student developers a pet project for you^When I was a student at UIUC (many, many moons ago), I created two websites - one of them I cranked out in just a weekend, the other was a labor of love. The labor of love was called openingbands.com and is now defunct - that's not the subject of this post.
is racism a problem at uiuc^I'm a black female considering attending UIUC for computer science. I kind of expect that since it's in a rural part of Illinois, I'm destined to encounter more overtly racist/otherwise offensive comments than one would here in Chicago. But a lot of what I've been reading has made me somewhat uncomfortable about attending the school. I've heard about a White Student Union forming and sharing photographs and personal information about black students; about black students being called racial slurs right to their faces; and all sorts of other ignorant or outright offensive behavior.
what are your favorite and least favorite things^I got accepted to UIUC as a transfer (ME), but I'm not so sure about enrolling.
uiuc haven plus sexual assault and prevention^"Just want to see if anyone else received this email for a ""mandatory"" survey. It didnt seem similar to other mass uiuc survey/class emails i've received in the past."
in your opinion what sets uiuc apart from other^Prospective student here. I want to know you guys' ideas ob what aspects of the UIUC set it apart from other colleges and universities?
my correspondence with suburban expresss lawyer^Update: no lawsuit
cool thingsplaces to explore at uiuc super thread^Since browsing this sub i have heard about that crazy puzzle thing at the MEL and the creepy grave room of Noyes. Let's have* people add on to these as well as share other cool and strange things/places at UIUC to explore.
has anyone here got accepted through a petition^I'm feeling really depressed, I got denied from Business at UIUC and even denied for DGS. This came as a complete shock to me as my guidance counselor told me there was no way UIUC would deny me for general admission. I have no idea what to do now, UIUC was essentially my top choice, my sisters went there, and my parents expected me to go there. I had a 32 ACT, and a 3.67 UW GPA in all honors/AP classes. I was wondering if I applied to a major through the petitioning process, would I have a decent shot at getting in still? Or should I just give up on my UIUC dream :(. If I do end up petitioning, I would get into UIUC, and then attempt to transfer out to my intended major.
torn between uiuc and cornell^Hi everyone.
wondering about cliquey uiuc brown town culture^Using a throwaway because some of my UIUC friends know my reddit username.
whats great about uiuc^I'm from Taiwan, and I got accepted by several universities in America, including here. However, I can;t make the trip to visit schools, so help me out and share what is great about life at UIUC
ruiuc broke 7000 subscribers^Granted, a lot of them might be SubEX, but numbers are numbers!
uiuc meet your classmates^Hey guys, after attending UIUC for a few years, I realized that I didn't know many of the people in my classes, especially large classes and courses outside of my major. So I built an app for UIUC students that will make it easier to meet, communicate and eventually work together with the other students in your class. It's called Studycloud.me and its goal is to make it easy to find and strike up a conversation with people in your course that share interests or mutual friends.
conservatives at uiuc^What is it like to be a conservative at Illinois? Have you participated in the College Republicans? I'm looking to find a solid team of people after I transfer in!
heads up ruiuc cops are pulling over bicyclists^Hi. I didn't see anything like a course review website at UIUC (the closest thing is ECE and CS courses wiki), so I though it would be cool to have all the reviews available at one place so we can use it later for our registration purposes, especially when picking the right electives to take. I know it's probably late for this semester's registration, but I hope it will be useful in the future.
a friend and i created a course review website^We first met at a /r/UIUC meetup hosted by /u/lebenszeichen and her friend in October 2013. Then /u/bnorick posted this missed connection that luckily wasn't downvoted too much. A friend pointed it out to me the next day and the rest is history!
because of this subreddit ubnorick and i are^I am a senior in High School right now, and am thinking about going to UIUC to study CS for college. I was wondering about how 'life' is there to decide whether I want to go or not. EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback! I can't wait!
ow is uiuc^I'm a senior in High School right now, and wanted to know about what people don't like about UIUC. I'm looking at either Computer Engineering or Computer Science. How is the engineering CS life? How is general life at UIUC?

nofficial uiuc guide^Racism Claims:

ts/3tgw01/day of drama for ruiuc bomb threats and white^So I was working on a MP in grainger basement and saw a homie had a cool desktop background. It looked like a view from an airplane of UIUC's campus but stylized like a frame from a Miyazaki film. Anyone know what I'm talking about? I would've asked him where he got it from but he was jamming with headphones. <3 ty
how are you guys paying for uiuc^As a student from Asia and want to apply for UIUC for graduate study, I have finished my draft of Statement of Purpose (SOP) and sent it to this editor for proofreading and editing.

I'd prefer the policy was just be excellent to each other But sometimes I'm forced to make decisions, and people have asked me for a set of rules, so here they are. Feel free to discuss them here or via moderator mail. Ask for clarification if you're confused.
i miss you uiuc^I've just been completely shocked by the business actions of this bus company over the four years that I've been here. Peoria Charter might not have the most frequent times, but they definitely treat their customers better. Therefore, I am BEGGING my fellow Illini to boycott Suburban Express. You can see from the link above the UIUC subreddit all the horrible things they've done to UIUC students, just look at the way they treat dissatisfied customers on Yelp (responses courtesy of the rude CEO himself). Take a second to read about how abusive this company is, and decide for yourself.
uiuc rules^I am international student planning to join UIUC Fall 2017 for Computer Science. After talking to multiple people who have already graduated, I have come to know that from an academic point of view UIUC is really really good, one of the best in the country, with not many issues at all. I have also got admission into USC(with a 20K scholarship) making the cost of attendance for UIUC and USC the same.
hey uiuc we need to talk^I just finished my Junior year of highschool and the college search is well underway. I want to go into CE (computer engineering), and according to US News it is number 3 in the country for CE. How do you redditors feel about attending UIUC? What do you like, and what do you dislike?

I'd like to get into the whole college spirit and learn about the athletes, leagues, coaches, history, etc. of UIUC and college football in general. Where do I start?
official suburban express boycott^I'll be joining the MBA program as an international student in the fall, and I'm looking at the different options for housing at UIUC. What would you guys recommend? I'm looking for a cheap, secure place with laundry facilities nearby.
social life at uiuc^"People are taking a lot of interesting actions regarding this issue. Personally, I think the banner across the top of our subreddit is a good thing, but the ""fake twitter account"" just makes us look like children. A ""boycott"" is nice and sensational and fun. But I'd like to propose keeping the ""high ground"" and matter-of-factly spreading information to UIUC students."

i want to get into football since im coming to^I've been apart of this sub-reddit for a while. I was wondering are there any negatives that UIUC may hold, because from reading the threads and comments it seems as if this college would make a perfect match. I was also wondering what mistakes should I avoid freshman year. Lastly; I'm planning to pursue a degree in international affairs and probably a minor in poli-sci and I was wondering do you guys/gals have any tips for me to make sure I keep my grades intact.(I'm looking forward to attending a top graduate school also.)
graduate housing at uiuc^"Last night at the student senate meeting, a senator from LAS, suggested that the Student Senate actively monitor reddit and create a ~""pro-student senate only"" /r/uiuc reddit thread. Fortunately, the ISS President argued against this."
the high ground and suburban express^I am an EA CoE-CS admit and UIUC is my first choice. I love it. But, though I am going to try my best to bargain with financial aid office, I know I most likely will not be able to afford or attend, and it's making me feel really shitty because of how much I love the school and the program. So, to help me love it less, please tell me some thing(s) you dislike about attending, anything big or small.
uiuc panty thief uncovered by 4chan^Why is cheating on exams so rampant at this university? I hear people openly talking about how they are going to cheat before the exam, standing up and running over to their friends to compare answers as they turn in their exams, continuing their exams for 5-10 minutes after time is up, and if I sit in the back of an exam room and look up, the whole room is a sea of phone screens. How has it gotten to the point where such a large volume of students can cheat so blatantly without changes being made to our testing environments? This is seriously concerning because it both hurts those of us who work hard when exams are curved, and it devalues our degrees when all these people who cheated their way through graduate. Why does UIUC allow this to happen and is there anything we can do to stop it?
spring 2017 schedule megathread^It seems like the last reddit dating match-up went pretty well, and it's been almost exactly a year since the last one, so maybe you guys would be interested in trying something like that again.
uiuc dining app^Hey guys,
a short open letter of appreciation to the uipd^I was looking into consolidating my student loans and it turns out that UIUC is a part of the new Social Financing program (alumni backed student loans). Current rates on their site blow away anything from a private lender and most un-subsidized federal loans. I'm waiting on payoff documents from my current lenders, but if there is interest, I can post my results and rate later on.

Given that people had mixed feelings regarding Chief in the banner, and our moderator NegatedVoid's comment, I've omitted any portrayal of Chief in this banner design, instead focusing on the Alma Mater, images of the main quad, Foellinger, and Bardeen quad, and the University seal.

We're a group of students building full-scale planes. Right now, we're in the finals of a competition to win $25,000 with Zipcar and Ford, and we need some help. A part of the competition involves a public vote on submitted videos made by each organization. If you could take a second and press the ""heart"" button under our video, it'd be greatly appreciated. The link for the competition is at the end of this post. If you want to check out where we’re at on the other two planes, here’s the link to our website: http://sab.ae.illinois.edu/. We're the only engineering group in the competition, and we think that using the money to fund hangar transport and aircraft components that will be used to educate students in aircraft manufacturing and design would be awesome!

After some heated body contact on court, he pulled me aside and said ""I'll kick your ass so hard you'll fly back to commie land, you little chink"", exactly these words.

uiuc mtg sceneclub^I have had friends halfway in the semester avoid the buses because they didn't know the bus times/routes. But unlike other big schools, UIUC has a pretty advanced/intuitive bus system. Checkout https://www.cumtd.com/ and get familiar with bus routes near you and when they depart outside your dorm/classes. Once you know the buses you'll be more comfortable exploring the campus and be a lot more mobile! Some routes like the Green, Teal, 22 run up till I believe 2-3am as well (every 20-30 minutes as opposed to like 10 during the day), so it's good to know these routes if you're out and about late or when it's raining/winter.

I come from the UK and it's massive here but I will be underage during my time at UIUC. My concern is being an exchange student, if I get caught drinking unlike domestic students, I'll get kicked out of the country.

I don't think anyone's happy with this, but it is what it is.
some questions about life and engineering at uiuc^I was just getting really excited to order a veggie burger, when I noticed that Sliders was removed from EatCU. Tried calling local number, phone disconnected. Online ordering says the store is closed. I finally called customer service who informed me that the UIUC location is permanently closed.
ruiuc best of 2015 awards nomination thread^Hi! I've chosen UIUC as my place for the next four years, but there are lots of high school seniors who are currently debating whether UIUC is the right fit for them.
uiuc now trails usc by only 36 students for most^When I started writing this, I didn't realize I would create such a wall of text, but now that I've finished it, I kind of feel like shortening it would be a crime. This is a huge amount of reading, but I honestly think this has everything you need to know about your first year on campus (aside from rushing a frat). This will be a pretty good survival guide for any incoming students. I tried to be especially informational on dorm choice, as that is critical to your happiness at UIUC.

I realize that if I ask something like ""This college vs UIUC"", I'm going receive responses with bias, so I wanted to ask you guys why you attend UIUC. But if any of you know anything or were debating whether to go to Georgia Tech, can you tell me why you decided to go to UIUC over GaTech?"
cumtd ama tomorrow^Hey guys, UW student here. I'll be at UIUC for a conference in late June (ISMS...anyone else going?) and I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to get back to Madison on Monday night.

gorgeous day today on uiuc campus^I am sure with such a wonderfully diverse population at UIUC that several students/faculty/etc are either from France, have family in France, or have some other connection. I just wanted to extend my best wishes and condolences. I know it can't mean very much in light of such tragedy. But, if terrorism's goal is to assert their ideals via fear and force, the only truly effective response I can see is one of love, camaraderie, and positivity.
how does uiuc view illinois community college^"There have been a few comments in another r/uiuc thread suggesting that there may be systemic problems with CS 374 (officially still ""CS 498 374""), the new undergraduate theoretical computer science course required for all CS and CE majors. This is the first semester that the course has been offered at full scale, to almost 400 students, and Chandra, Lenny, and I are all well aware that there will be growing pains. But we also know that we can't tell what all the growing pains are without feedback from the students."

As of right now I feel like I made the wrong decision major wise. I do have a passion in politics, but I think my passion may change once I enter college.

n unfortunate trend here at ruiuc^My friend was accepted to Iowa State Engineering with a large scholarship, and UIUC DGS.

Would you reccomend him to go to Iowa State where he got engineering, or UIUC DGS? Thanks in advance!

I am just curious about the classroom experience (any recommended awesome class?), the professor (any great and unmissable professor?), and the overall atmosphere. How hard are the classes? Is the physics department really very big? How many undergraduate physics majors are there? Any advice or warning or reminder on applying to the physics undergraduate program?

I got better grades than ever on the first semester of senior but I guess I got senioritis and I think I might end up with a D or a C in AP Physics C. This is my first year taking AP classes and AP Physics is one of two I'm taking. My other classes are fine. I got into Communication major in UIUC which I believe has nothing to do with physics. I am worried that if I end up with a D in that class UIUC would rescind my admission... I know that I have to work harder for the remaining time but I just for the worst case senario..

I've heard both good and bad things. Some things that concern me are the fact that the program doesn't receive as much funding as other engineering departments so there's not as many resources/labs for AE.

hy are uiuc grad students only paid for 11 months^"I am from the new england area. I was at a large dinner party the other night, tagging along with my parents. We went around meeting several people and the topic of where I go to school constantly came up, naturally, as I was one of the few younger people around. Out of the 8-9 people we talked to, only 2 gave me that ""ah! illinois, of course"" type of answer. The rest didn't even seem to know much about UIUC at all. Saying 'UIUC' is practically unrecognizable, so I have to use the ""university of illinois"" to clarify that it is a large state school in the state of illinois, to get people an idea of where I go. This has happened several times in the past, and most people who recognize UIUC are either alumni I run into or engineers. To be perfectly honest, it feels good to go to chicago and have people recognize the U of I brand, but I am surprised that most people who aren't engineers or from illinois have never heard much of this institution. This is a wonderful school with a lot of really smart people, why doesn't its brand have even close of a reach that other schools get when you say ""UCLA"" ""Berkeley"" ""Michigan"" or ""Northwestern"" ?"

I have been told I need to budget for $8500 for the semester, this being about £5500. I pay tuition to my home institution as normal so it is not a factor).

However, I am not sure about the cost of living in Champaign-Urbana. Can anyone give me an idea about what is a modest monthly sum required for living with a family of three (no eating out or maintaining a frugal lifestyle). FYI - My stipend will be around 1700 USD/ month for 9 months. Is it possible to live in that sum? Or do I need additional sum? if yes, how much? Thanks in advance for writing back!

He instantly became so angry and defensive and started pointing at the fake bill on the front of his binder for $561 before I slammed the door on him."

would anyone be interested in a uiuc open data api^Hello to you all. I am currently debating on whether to transfer to UIC or UIUC for the spring semester. I am sort of leaning towards UIUC but this is a very hard decision. I am a pre-med student, and I know that they both have good pre-med programs. The one thing I am concerned about is that I will get bored at UIUC. I live in Chicago, and I've lived here or in the suburbs of Chicago my whole life. I am not a party person. I know for sure, I will never be in to that. But, on the other side, I know that a lot of current UIC students hate it there because they say the campus looks ugly, the professors aren't that great, and they were basically forced to go there since it's close to home. I just want to know more on both schools before I officially decide. So, any help would be great! I just need honest opinions from students of both schools. Thanks!

uiuc made it onto google maps pokemon^I don't think any major is easy if you don't put in the work, but if we assume a given student will put in the same amount of work into every major, which major will end up giving this student the highest GPA?
ae at uiuc^I got admitted to my second choice major - Engineering Mechanics. First choice was Computer Science Engineering. Did not understand when I applied that EM and ME are not the same programs. Now, I am concerned about the marketability of EM program. Why do so few people enroll in EM? Stats show that half of them go on to graduate school. If I still want to pursue a career in IT industry, would it be beneficial to take a Computer Science minor? How difficult will it be to transfer into ME, or EE? I assume transferring to CS engineering will be very competitive. **I am not the brightest student out there but am ready to work hard to succeed.

uiuc student interns at google the white house^"I keep overhearing that the student senate has become a place where our tuition is wasted on unnecessary things (they apparently tried to use 15000 dollars on robes for a black choir group..?) and that whenever a senator votes against an initiative that relates to minorities in anyway, he/she is called a racist, told ""quit your whining, thats privilege"" and ""practically booed of the floor"" as some users on this sub have shared. As a student, I would much rather have a senate that votes with reason and without some agenda fueled by bitterness towards parts of the UIUC population. I want senators who will vote on something not because ""it would be racist if you didn't"" but because it is a proper allocation of student funds. I am not part of the ISS, so these are just rumors to me. However I would like to know what everyone else here thinks."

looking for feedback on new live uiuc app is my^"If you are deciding to come to this university being admitted as DGS student or a general curriculum student in the college of LAS I highly advise you to not come to this university. It is a scam of a major/department that this university has created. I'm telling you this out of my own experience. I came to this university admitted as a DGS student, when I went for orientation that prepared me for my endeavor to transfer into the college of engineering I thought it was definitely possible. Little did I know how hard it was to transfer and the advisers, who were talking to the newly admitted DGS students as ""fresh bait"", were kind enough to even mention that things were about to change. After a semester passed, the requirements to get into the CS program and CompE program got harder and I had to work even harder than before to try and transfer in. After you spend one or two years here trying to transfer, you will inevitably make friends and try to settle down like any other human would do. Then when time comes and they reject you from your dream major, you will have to settle for a major that you don't like but you'll stick with because your already there and transferring to another college would just be so much of a hassle. The academic advisers do not help at all, they tell you one thing a month before when you visit them and then when you go and talk to them again after another month they will change there minds and say now the requirements have changed and you have to take three more steps to do anything worthwhile. You will be trapped into staying here, they'll just take your tuition, and you will have to settle a lot for all the second choices you didn't want to choose. I wish someone told me this when I submitted my decision to come here. I don't want this university to prosper with this program so I would rather warn other students trying to make there decision to come here as a DGS student. DGS is a scam, don't let them trick you into settling for something you don't want to do, follow your dreams and DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!"

I tell them that UIUC is worth the cost because it is in the top 5 for my major(CS) but they say I should stay in-state for undergrad. I definitely have a very small chance for UT and TexasA&M will probably be my best bet as far as in state. I just want to know if any of you guys have been in a similar situation, and I would love any input. Thanks.

a duet between uiucs kim jon un and obama^Hi, I'm a senior in high school right now from Georgia and I was accepted into ChemE at UIUC. I also applied to GT, but was denied, so that's out of the question. I want to go to UIUC, but looking at it, the cost will be around $50k. I didn't get any scholarships in my acceptance letter, and I probably won't qualify for need-based aid. My parents will pay for a good portion of it (~35k) but the rest is up to me. Should I stay in Georgia or come to UIUC?
